The purpose of the .NET ESAPI is to provide a simple interface that provides all the ordinary security functions a developer is likely to need in a clear, consistent, and easy to use way.

The .NET ESAPI architecture is very simple, just a collection of classes that encapsulate the key security operations most applications need.

Please see the OWASP ESAPI page for more details:
